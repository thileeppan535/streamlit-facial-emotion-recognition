Emotion Detection from Uploaded Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract:
This project develops a user-friendly application to detect and classify emotions in
facial images uploaded by users. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), pre-trained models, and computer vision techniques, the system recognizes
emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc., with high accuracy. The application
integrates a simple Streamlit interface and applies ethical considerations to ensure
fairness and privacy in detection outcomes.
